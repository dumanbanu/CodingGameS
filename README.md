# CodingGame Crystal Rush

-Some of the things that were defined before we started the game were given to us.

-There was also a definition in which we will find our ore in an array. Our gem is called 'item' and it is the 5th element of the array.

-My basic algorithm is to dig the ore. I didn't use any traps or radars.

-I have defined random functions for the X and Y coordinates, so each time the map changes, the number of ores it finds depends on our luck.

-If the random coordinate we assigned has ore, we go to the starting point. If there is no ore in the random coordinate we assign, it travels through the random coordinates; if it finds ore, it goes back to the beginning.

-Even in such a simple algorithm, I was promoted to the Bronze league. If I used trap and radar, I can't even imagine what would happen.
